For now, this website contains no serious or particularly useful information.  It exists as my learning tool and playground for HTML.  As I learn new HTML concepts like adding links, input fields, etc., I add them to this page.  Eventually, I will update it to contain real information so that it serves as an extention of my resume.  Until then, enjoy the picture of the honey badger and NASA's pic of the day.
